# Logto Organization Management

This document details how we manage organizations (companies) in Logto and synchronize them with our application's company data.

## Overview

In our application, companies are represented as organizations in Logto. This allows us to:

1. Manage user memberships in organizations
2. Assign roles to users within organizations
3. Control access to company resources based on organization membership and roles

## Organization Creation

When a company is created in our application, we also create a corresponding organization in Logto:

```typescript
// Example company creation flow in CompaniesController
public async store({ request, auth, response }: HttpContextContract) {
  const user = await auth.use('logto').user()
  const companyData = await request.validate(CreateCompanyValidator)
  
  // Create company in our database
  const company = new Company()
  company.name = companyData.name
  company.description = companyData.description
  // ... set other company properties
  
  // Create organization in Logto
  const managementApiService = new LogtoManagementApiService()
  const logtoOrganization = await managementApiService.createOrganization(
    companyData.name,
    companyData.description || undefined
  )
  
  // Store the Logto organization ID
  company.externalId = logtoOrganization.id
  await company.save()
  
  // Add the current user to the organization
  console.log(`Adding user ${user.externalId} to Logto organization ${logtoOrganization.id}`)
  await managementApiService.addUserToOrganization(
    user.externalId,
    logtoOrganization.id
  )
  
  // Assign the admin role to the user
  try {
    console.log(`Assigning admin role to user ${user.externalId} in organization ${logtoOrganization.id}`)
    await managementApiService.assignUserOrganizationRoles(
      user.externalId,
      logtoOrganization.id,
      ['admin'] // Use the role name instead of the ID
    )
  } catch (roleError) {
    console.error('Failed to assign admin role to user:', roleError)
    // Continue even if role assignment fails
  }
  
  // Create the user-company relationship
  await company.related('users').attach({
    [user.id]: {
      role: 'admin',
      is_primary: true,
      custom_data: JSON.stringify({}),
    }
  })
  
  return response.created(company)
}
```

## Organization Management API

The `LogtoManagementApiService` provides methods for managing organizations in Logto:

### Creating Organizations

```typescript
async createOrganization(name: string, description?: string): Promise<any> {
  const payload: any = { name }
  if (description) {
    payload.description = description
  }
  return this.request('/organizations', 'POST', payload)
}
```

### Adding Users to Organizations

When adding a user to an organization, we use the Logto Management API:

```typescript
async addUserToOrganization(userId: string, organizationId: string): Promise<any> {
  const payload = {
    userIds: [userId]
  }
  return this.request(`/organizations/${organizationId}/users`, 'POST', payload)
}
```

This method sends a POST request to the `/organizations/{id}/users` endpoint with a payload containing the user ID:

```json
{
  "userIds": ["user-id"]
}
```

### Removing Users from Organizations

To remove a user from an organization:

```typescript
async removeUserFromOrganization(userId: string, organizationId: string): Promise<any> {
  return this.request(`/organizations/${organizationId}/users/${userId}`, 'DELETE')
}
```

### Assigning Roles to Users

To assign roles to a user within an organization:

```typescript
async assignUserOrganizationRoles(userId: string, organizationId: string, roleNames: string[]): Promise<any> {
  return this.request(`/organizations/${organizationId}/users/${userId}/roles`, 'POST', {
    organizationRoleNames: roleNames
  })
}
```

This method sends a POST request to the `/organizations/{id}/users/{userId}/roles` endpoint with a payload containing the role names:

```json
{
  "organizationRoleNames": ["admin"]
}
```

**Important**: Use role names (e.g., 'admin') rather than role IDs when assigning roles to users.

### Getting User Roles in an Organization

To get the roles assigned to a user in an organization:

```typescript
async getUserOrganizationRoles(organizationId: string, userId: string): Promise<any> {
  return this.request(`/organizations/${organizationId}/users/${userId}/roles`, 'GET')
}
```

## Organization Roles

We use the following organization roles in Logto:

1. **admin**: Organization administrators with full control
2. **member**: Regular organization members with limited permissions

### Ensuring Organization Roles Exist

Before assigning roles to users, we ensure that the necessary organization roles exist in Logto:

```typescript
async ensureOrganizationRoles(roles: Array<{ name: string, description?: string }>): Promise<any> {
  try {
    // Get existing organization roles
    const existingRoles = await this.getOrganizationRoles()
    const existingRoleNames = existingRoles.map((role: any) => role.name)
    
    // Create missing roles
    const rolesToCreate = roles.filter(role => !existingRoleNames.includes(role.name))
    const createdRoles = []
    
    for (const role of rolesToCreate) {
      try {
        const createdRole = await this.createOrganizationRole(role.name, role.description)
        createdRoles.push(createdRole)
      } catch (error) {
        console.error(`Failed to create organization role ${role.name}:`, error)
      }
    }
    
    return {
      existingRoles,
      createdRoles
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to ensure organization roles:', error)
    throw error
  }
}
```

### Creating Organization Roles

To create an organization role:

```typescript
async createOrganizationRole(name: string, description?: string): Promise<any> {
  const payload: any = { name, type: 'User' }
  if (description) {
    payload.description = description
  }
  return this.request('/organization-roles', 'POST', payload)
}
```

## Synchronization Between Systems

### Company Creation

When a company is created in our application:

1. Create the company in our database
2. Create an organization in Logto
3. Store the Logto organization ID in our company record
4. Add the current user to the organization
5. Assign the admin role to the user
6. Create the user-company relationship in our database

### User Addition

When a user is added to a company:

1. Add the user to the company in our database
2. Add the user to the organization in Logto
3. Assign appropriate roles to the user in Logto

### User Removal

When a user is removed from a company:

1. Remove the user from the company in our database
2. Remove the user from the organization in Logto

## Error Handling

We handle errors that may occur during organization management:

```typescript
try {
  // Attempt to add user to organization
  await managementApiService.addUserToOrganization(
    user.externalId,
    logtoOrganization.id
  )
  
  // Attempt to assign roles
  await managementApiService.assignUserOrganizationRoles(
    user.externalId,
    logtoOrganization.id,
    ['admin']
  )
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Failed to manage organization membership:', error)
  // Handle error appropriately
}
```

## API Response Handling

The Logto API returns different response formats for different endpoints:

- Some endpoints return JSON responses
- Some endpoints (like adding users to organizations) return plain text responses

Our `request` method in the `LogtoManagementApiService` handles these different response formats:

```typescript
private async request(endpoint: string, method: string, data?: any): Promise<any> {
  try {
    // Authentication and request preparation
    const accessToken = await this.getAccessToken()
    const url = `${this.baseUrl}${endpoint}`
    
    console.log(`Logto API request: ${method} ${endpoint}`)
    if (data) {
      console.log('Logto API request body:', data)
    }
    
    // Make the request
    const response = await fetch(url, {
      method,
      headers: {
        'Authorization': `Bearer ${accessToken}`,
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
      },
      body: data ? JSON.stringify(data) : undefined
    })
    
    console.log(`Logto API response status: ${response.status} ${response.statusText}`)
    
    // Handle response
    if (!response.ok) {
      const errorText = await response.text()
      console.error(`Logto API error (${response.status}):`, errorText)
      throw new LogtoError(`Logto API error (${response.status}): ${errorText}`)
    }
    
    const responseText = await response.text()
    console.log(`Logto API response for ${endpoint} (truncated):`, responseText.substring(0, 100))
    
    // Special case for plain text responses
    if (endpoint.includes('/organizations/') && endpoint.includes('/users') && responseText === 'Created') {
      console.log('Received plain text Created response for organization users endpoint')
      return { status: 'success', message: 'Created' }
    }
    
    // Parse JSON response
    try {
      return JSON.parse(responseText)
    } catch (e) {
      // Handle non-JSON responses
      if (responseText && responseText.trim()) {
        console.log(`Received plain text response for ${endpoint}:`, responseText)
        return { status: 'success', message: responseText }
      }
      throw new LogtoError(`Failed to parse API response: ${endpoint}`, e)
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(`Error in Logto API request to ${endpoint}:`, error)
    throw error
  }
}
```

## Testing Organization Management

To test organization management:

1. Create a company and verify that an organization is created in Logto
2. Add a user to the company and verify that they are added to the organization in Logto
3. Assign roles to the user and verify that the roles are assigned in Logto
4. Remove the user from the company and verify that they are removed from the organization in Logto
