It's not recommended to set `Port` unless the\n                                      networking behaviors specified in a Route must apply to a specific port\n                                      as opposed to a listener(s) whose port(s) may be changed. When both Port\n                                      and SectionName are specified, the name and port of the selected listener\n                                      must match both specified values.\n\n                                      \u003cgateway:experimental:description\u003e\n                                      When the parent resource is a Service, this targets a specific port in the\n                                      Service spec. When both Port (experimental) and SectionName are specified,\n                                      the name and port of the selected port must match both specified values.\n                                      \u003c/gateway:experimental:description\u003e\n\n                                      Implementations MAY choose to support other parent resources.\n                                      Implementations supporting other types of parent resources MUST clearly\n                                      document how/if Port is interpreted.\n\n                                      For the purpose of status, an attachment is considered successful as\n                                      long as the parent resource accepts it partially. For example, Gateway\n                                      listeners can restrict which Routes can attach to them by Route kind,\n                                      namespace, or hostname. If 1 of 2 Gateway listeners accept attachment\n                                      from the referencing Route, the Route MUST be considered successfully\n                                      attached. If no Gateway listeners accept attachment from this Route,\n                                      the Route MUST be considered detached from the Gateway.\n\n                                      Support: Extended\n                                    type: integer\n                                    format: int32\n                                    maximum: 65535\n                                    minimum: 1\n                                  sectionName:\n                                    description: |-\n                                      SectionName is the name of a section within the target resource.

It's not recommended to set `Port` unless the\n                                      networking behaviors specified in a Route must apply to a specific port\n                                      as opposed to a listener(s) whose port(s) may be changed. When both Port\n                                      and SectionName are specified, the name and port of the selected listener\n                                      must match both specified values.\n\n                                      \u003cgateway:experimental:description\u003e\n                                      When the parent resource is a Service, this targets a specific port in the\n                                      Service spec. When both Port (experimental) and SectionName are specified,\n                                      the name and port of the selected port must match both specified values.\n                                      \u003c/gateway:experimental:description\u003e\n\n                                      Implementations MAY choose to support other parent resources.\n                                      Implementations supporting other types of parent resources MUST clearly\n                                      document how/if Port is interpreted.\n\n                                      For the purpose of status, an attachment is considered successful as\n                                      long as the parent resource accepts it partially. For example, Gateway\n                                      listeners can restrict which Routes can attach to them by Route kind,\n                                      namespace, or hostname. If 1 of 2 Gateway listeners accept attachment\n                                      from the referencing Route, the Route MUST be considered successfully\n                                      attached. If no Gateway listeners accept attachment from this Route,\n                                      the Route MUST be considered detached from the Gateway.\n\n                                      Support: Extended\n                                    type: integer\n                                    format: int32\n                                    maximum: 65535\n                                    minimum: 1\n                                  sectionName:\n                                    description: |-\n                                      SectionName is the name of a section within the target resource.
