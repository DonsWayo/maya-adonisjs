# Maya AdonisJS Project Architecture

This is a sophisticated monorepo built with AdonisJS 6, featuring multiple applications and shared packages designed for scalability and maintainability.

## Project Structure

```
maya-adonisjs/
├── apps/
│   ├── main/           # Central Control Plane
│   ├── monitoring/     # Error monitoring and analytics
│   └── docs/          # Documentation site (Next.js)
├── packages/
│   ├── ui/            # Shared UI component library
│   ├── eslint-config/ # Shared ESLint configuration
│   └── typescript-config/ # Shared TypeScript configuration
└── config/            # Shared configuration files
```

## Multi-App Architecture Vision

### Central Control Plane (Main App)

The `main` app serves as the **central control plane** for the entire ecosystem:

- **Core Entity Management**: Users, Companies, Projects, Teams, Permissions
- **Authentication & Authorization**: Logto integration, role-based access control
- **Shared Services**: Email, notifications, file storage, audit logs
- **API Gateway**: Provides APIs for other apps to consume shared data
- **Admin Interface**: Central management UI for system administrators

### Focused Applications

Other apps are designed to be lightweight and focused:

- Each app handles its specific domain (monitoring, billing, CRM, etc.)
- Apps consume shared entities via APIs from main
- Apps can have their own specialized databases/services
- All apps share the same authentication system managed by main

## Key Technologies

| Technology | Purpose | Version |
|------------|---------|---------|
| **AdonisJS** | Backend Framework | 6.x |
| **React** | Frontend Framework | 19.x |
| **Inertia.js** | Full-stack Framework | Latest |
| **TailwindCSS** | Styling | v4 |
| **PostgreSQL** | Primary Database | Latest |
| **TimescaleDB** | Time-series Extension | Latest |
| **PgAI** | AI Database Extension | Latest |
| **ClickHouse** | Analytics Database | Latest |
| **Logto** | Authentication | Latest |
| **Docker** | Containerization | Latest |
| **Turbo** | Build System | Latest |
| **pnpm** | Package Manager | Latest |

## Architecture Principles

### 1. Domain-Driven Design

Each app uses domain modules for clean separation:

```
app/
├── auth/           # Authentication domain
├── users/         # User management domain
├── companies/     # Company management domain
├── projects/      # Project management domain
└── analytics/     # Analytics domain
```

### 2. Shared Components

UI components are centralized in the `@workspace/ui` package:

- Consistent design system across all apps
- Shared Shadcn/UI components with New York style
- Reusable hooks and utilities
- Type-safe component props

### 3. Type Safety

Full TypeScript coverage across all applications:

- Strict TypeScript configuration
- Shared type definitions
- InferPageProps for Inertia.js pages
- API contract types

### 4. Modern Stack

Uses latest versions and features:

- React 19 with Concurrent Features
- AdonisJS 6 with ESM support
- TailwindCSS v4 with CSS Layer API
- Modern build tools and optimizations

### 5. Monorepo Management

Efficient package management and build system:

- pnpm workspaces for dependency management
- Turbo for build orchestration and caching
- Shared configurations across packages
- Incremental builds and testing

## Import Patterns

### Path Mapping

Use `#` prefix for internal imports in AdonisJS apps:

```typescript
import UserController from '#controllers/users_controller'
import User from '#models/user'
import UserService from '#services/user_service'
```

### Workspace References

Use workspace references for shared packages:

```typescript
import { Button } from '@workspace/ui/components/button'
import { cn } from '@workspace/ui/lib/utils'
```

### React Router

Never use `react-router-dom` - use `react-router` instead:

```typescript
// ✅ Correct
import { useParams, useLoaderData } from "react-router"

// ❌ Incorrect
import { useParams, useLoaderData } from "react-router-dom"
```

## File Naming Conventions

| Type | Convention | Example |
|------|------------|---------|
| **Controllers** | PascalCase + Controller | `UsersController` |
| **Models** | PascalCase singular | `User`, `Company` |
| **Services** | PascalCase + Service | `UserService` |
| **Components** | PascalCase | `UserProfile` |
| **Pages** | PascalCase + Page | `UsersIndexPage` |
| **Types** | PascalCase | `UserData` |

## Docker Integration

### Multi-Stage Builds

Each app uses multi-stage Dockerfiles:

- **Development stage**: Hot reload, debugging tools
- **Production stage**: Optimized builds, minimal dependencies

### Service Communication

Services communicate using Docker network hostnames:

- Database: `pgsql:5432`
- Redis: `redis:6379`
- ClickHouse: `clickhouse:8123`
- Authentication: `logto:3001`

### Traefik Routing

All services are accessible via `.localhost` domains:

- Main app: `main.localhost`
- Monitoring: `monitoring.localhost`
- Docs: `docs.localhost`
- Authentication: `logto.localhost`

## Scalability Considerations

### Horizontal Scaling

The architecture supports adding new apps easily:

1. Create new app directory in `apps/`
2. Configure authentication with main app
3. Define API contracts for shared data
4. Add to Docker Compose and Traefik
5. Update build pipeline

### Data Scaling

- PostgreSQL with TimescaleDB for time-series data
- ClickHouse for analytics and reporting
- Redis for caching and sessions
- AI capabilities with PgAI and Ollama

### Build Scaling

- Turbo caching for fast builds
- Incremental builds based on changes
- Parallel execution of independent tasks
- Remote caching support for teams
